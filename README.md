# Work Day Scheduler 
This is working day schedule. It is a 9 to 5 day scheduler that once it gets
past the current hour it will gray it out, and all future hours will be in green.
It also allows you to add events and it will save it in local storage.
It was an assingment from University of Utah, we were provided with the started code and had to do the JavaScript from scratch.
